## Updates
#### Dev Update — July 6th, 2023 🥰
We have relocated to a beautiful home in the suburbs of Langely, BC. There has been a LOT of work unpacking, organizing, and landscaping to get this home perfect for our two toddlers! I am hoping to resume development of the theme in the next couple months!

On a really interesting note, Webflow has launched a React component export tool. I am considering moving all component design and management over to Webflow for easier tooling for marketing teams and visual designers! 
#### Dev Update — Feb 13th, 2023 [Updated: March 05th, 2023]
Jest has been setup, but no progress on building tests has been made. Life is busy atm! 
#### Dev Update — Feb 10th, 2023
I am currently taking a short break in development of this theme. I am in the final phases of a job search, and getting ready to move into a bigger place to give some much needed room to my growing family! I am hoping to continue development before the end of next quarter!

## This website is still being developed! 🥳
The porftofolio application has currently hit the Beta phase and is ready to be forked if you are familiar with React and Next. The next release cycle will focus on a better DX—moving from local JSON to MongoDB, setting up Sanity for GUI page editing, Unit Testing with Jest, adding TypeScript, etc.

## Please fork this repo! 🦄

Fork, Install, Editing, and Deploy instructions coming soon(ish)!

This is my first open-source contribution, and it was also a great oppoortunity for me to learn! 

It is my hope that by sharing this project it can give others a chance to enjoy learning Nextjs (and have as much fun as I did), and hopefully brings value to people as a portfolio and networking tool!
